# Useful YAMLs
A collection of examples yamls that I find myself creating a lot. Stuff like
simple deployments or Knative Services, values files, and overlays.

Hopefully I remember to use this and add to it :fingers-crossed:

## TODOs
* [ ] Turn `apps/breakable` into an endpoint on `apps/debug`
* [ ] Turn `apps/https-example` into an https server on `apps/debug`
